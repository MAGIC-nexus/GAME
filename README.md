# GAME
Source code and WAR packaging of the **MAGIC NEXUS GAME** http://magic-nexus.eu/magic-nexus-game

**Magic Nexus Game** is an educational game created to help students and other users to experiment with some scenario analysis related to the energy-water-food relationship and to facilitate the understanding of the key relationships of the so-called _nexus_.
The game is designed to work on multiple levels (a basic one aiming to make users confident about the interface, and some more complex levels aiming to add more realism and degrees of interaction through simulations).

*Magic Nexus Game is an open system and uses open-source components.*
